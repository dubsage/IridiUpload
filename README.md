# IridiUpload
This program allows you to update one existing Iridi project on the Iridi cloud. Then update the project on the server, like a UMC C3.

First of all, you need to enter your username and password. Get all projects from the iridi cloud. Then choose the one you want to update. Select a file. Click "send to cloud". Optionally, you can enter a password on server (for example, UMC C3) and select a project to upload. Then click "update on server".

Hotkeys work right away, but to enable the download functions, you need to click the checkbox to the left of them.

The data is stored in the registry. Passwords are stored in encrypted form.

This program has a Windows GUI. You need Visual Studio 2019+ to build the project.
